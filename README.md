# Rust SQLite Demo

[Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQPPUOnUfpY)

This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations using Rust and SQLite. It showcases how to create a simple database, insert data, read from it, update records, and delete them.

## Dependencies

- Rust
- SQLite

## optimized Rust binary:

* generated by github actions for each push.
* can be found in Docker Image CI release [here](https://github.com/Nathan-Bush46/IDS706-rust-IP2/actions)

## Project Structure

- `main.rs`: Contains the main code for CRUD operations
- `test.rs`: Contains unit tests for the CRUD operations

## Running and Set

1. See Docker set up to install needed libraries. (This installs needed Dependencies for you)
3. Run `cargo build` to build the project. (or make)
4. Run `cargo run` to execute the program. (or use make all to build, lint, and run)
5. `make release` will make optimized binary and run it once
 
## Set up instructions using VS code + Docker: 
### Docker

1. For Windows, Mac, and maybe Linux, you download Docker Desktop. links can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Follow set up instructions and start the application.

2. In vs code add Dev Containers and Docker extensions 

3. clone repo, restart vs code, and open repo in vs code.

4. should see a pop up to (re)open in devcontainer. Click it and let it run. It takes a bit of time for the first run but is much faster after that. hit enter to install rust when promoted, restart terminal. Done.


## How AI Assisted in This Project

Throughout the development of this project, I utilized an AI language model (ChatGPT) to assist me in several ways:

1. **Code Generation**: I provided the AI with a simple Rust code snippet that demonstrated CRUD operations with SQLite. Based on this, I asked the AI to generate a corresponding `test.rs` file.

2. **Code Modification**: When I needed to change the method of checking if a table exists, I presented the AI with the existing code and requested a modification. The AI provided an updated version of the `setup()` function and a new test to check for table existence.

3. **Error Resolution**: When I encountered a warning about unused fields in the `Person` struct, I shared the warning message with the AI. In response, it provided multiple solutions to address the warning, explaining each approach.

4. **Documentation**: I asked the AI to create this README file, explaining how it was used in the development process.

By leveraging AI in these ways, I was able to streamline the development process, quickly generate test cases, and resolve issues more efficiently. However, all code and suggestions provided by the AI were reviewed and adapted as necessary to fit the specific needs of this project.
