# Rust SQLite Demo

This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations using Rust and SQLite.

## Dependencies

- Rust
- SQLite

## Running the Program

1. See Docker set up to install needed libraries 
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `cargo build` to build the project.
4. Run `cargo run` to execute the program. (or just cargo all to build, lint, and run)
 
## Set up instructions using VS code + Docker: 
### Docker
1. For Windows, Mac, and maybe Linux, you download Docker Desktop. links can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Follow set up instructions and start the application.

2. In vs code add Dev Containers and Docker extensions 

3. clone repo, restart vs code, and open repo in vs code.

4. should see a pop up to (re)open in devcontainer. Click it and let it run. It takes a bit of time for the first run but is much faster after that. hit enter to install rust when promoted, restart terminal. Done.
